# ESP32SpectrumDX6iToBLEGamepad
ESP32: Takes the 6 CH signal from Spectrum Transmitters, decodes it and sends it as blutooth controller to your PC/Mobile


You just need to connect the ESP pin 17 to the data cable of the mono headphone cable (you can just take a pair of old headphones and cut the left one off and use that connection). And also connect the ground to one ground pad. , ..:> Flash the firmware and power the esp via usb. Connect your created cable to the transmitter and it should power itsel on, dont use the power switch as this disables the trainer port

Use at your own risk. I take no liability. 
Tested with spectrum DX6i
